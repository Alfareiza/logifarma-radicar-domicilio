<h2>⚈ Overview </h2>

This application emerges as a direct response to a vital need within Colombia's private health system. Driven by the requests of numerous beneficiaries of state-subsidized medications, a multistep form was forged between these users and Logifarma in order to step aside Whatsapp which was where user requested their medicines.

In the pursuit of operational excellence, this solution empowers users to effortlessly requisition their medications, which are subsequently hand-delivered to their doorstep. This streamlined drug requests and control at Logifarma, enabling advanced delivery metrics and reporting.

In the present landscape, the application stands as a testament to its success, overseeing no less than 4,000 monthly medication requests,  across diverse corners of Colombia. Besides, its impact is magnified by a steady influx of 1,000+ new monthly users.


This initiative stands as a prime example of how technology can bridge essential gaps, enhancing user experience, optimizing operations, and enabling data-powered advancements. As I forge ahead, the application's impact is poised to scale even further, cementing its position as a transformative asset within Colombia's healthcare landscape.
